# Decorator Examples

Decorators can come in all kinds of shapes and forms.

This repository contains abstract examples of different decorator types
intended to help with boiler-plating decorators.

## The Examples

Here are two simple patterns for decorating functions:

* The majority of decorators probably fit this pattern: [simple.py](simple.py)
* Here's another simple pattern: [function_attrs.py](function_attrs.py)

Decorators can take arguments:

* [decorator_with_args.py](decorator_with_args.py)
* [decorator_with_optional_args.py](decorator_with_optional_args.py)

Decorators can work with classes too:

* Decorating classes: [decorating_classes.py](decorating_classes.py)
* Using classes as decorators: [class_as_a_decorator.py](class_as_a_decorator.py)
* Returning classes from decorators: [decorators_and_object_patterns.py](decorators_and_object_patterns.py)
